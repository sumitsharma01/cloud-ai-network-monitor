# Cloud AI Network Monitor
## Project Vision
Build a cloud-native, event-driven network monitoring platform leveraging AI/ML for real-time anomaly detection and incident response.  
Utilizes microservices, containerization, secure APIs, and React dashboard. Demonstrates Agile best practices, CI/CD, and cloud architecture.

## Tech Stack
- Python (FastAPI) for backend microservices  
- PyTorch/TensorFlow for anomaly detection  
- Kafka for event streaming  
- PostgreSQL for incident data  
- React.js for frontend dashboard  
- Docker & Kubernetes for containerization  
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Day 1 Goal
Setup project structure, planning, and initial GitHub repo with issues & Kanban board.
